            <p> Datsun's shot in the dark. The 300ZX, rocking Japan's first V6! From 1984 to 1989 this Fairlady
                dominated the Japanese sports touring market. This 80s daydream featured one of the earliest voice
                assistants, and the Z31 community dearly refers to her as "B*#!%ing Betty", as the security sensors are
                known to go bad and cause her to endlessly remind you to shut your door. This revolutionary car flaunted
                it's pop-up headlights and aggressive lines like none other.</p>

            <p> Hey, that's my car!!! This is my 1988 300zx, it's a 2+2 so it has a longer rear end. 
                In racing, they're almost always preferred due to their near 50/50 weight distribution!
                Currently, I've got it completely torn apart for a full rebuild. My goal is for it to feel like I just drove it off the lot! :D</p>
