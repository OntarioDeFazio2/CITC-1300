            <h2> "Nissan 300ZX (Z32) 1989-2000"</h2>
            <p>The Nissan 300ZX was Nissan's Magnum Opus of engineering. Throughout it's development, it would become
                the first sports car ever designed with CAD (Computer-Assisted design), and because of such it had an
                extremely aerodynamic body shape. Paired with it's new VG30DETT, a twin turboed, quad cammed V6 capable
                of easily boasting 280HP in stock form. The Z32's major weakness was it's overly heavy weight. Coming in
                at 3500 lbs from the factory, most long term owners find turbochargers to be the perfect fix. *The car
                was originally planned to take the Supra's place in Fast and the Furious! It ended up being replaced
                when there weren't enough slick-top models produced.* </p>

            <p> These photos are actually coming from Chattanooga! My buddy and I have painted and restored this Z32 over the past year now. 
                It's still got tons of work to accomplish, but I'm very proud of how the paint and body work turned out on our first attempt! </p>
