                            <p> This is a concept sketch of a Nissan 300ZX, also known as the Fairlady Z in the japanese market. It's a sporty, two door that was built to fit Nissan's Z-Car lineup. It was originally released in 1984, and ran until 1989. </p>

            <h2> If not, I'll change that.</h2>

                    <p>The Z car line is one that's lasted over 50 years, although not without it's struggles. The family line of the Fairlady is known for it's sleek, sporty and unique body lines, overall wedge shape, and it's use of 6-Cylinder engines for power. The Z-Cars originally came with Inline-6 L-Series engines. In 1984, the Inline-6 was replaced with the first V-6 engine to hail from japan, the VG30.</p>

            <h3>Don't think it's Z or Bust!</h3>

                    <p>Even if the Z-Car style doesn't light your fire, there's plenty to choose from. The Fairlady, along with the Silvia and Skyline are Nissan's legends. Every company had their own specialties, for specific reasons too. Mazda made the RX-7 series, and it had insane popularity due to it's use of a Wankel Rotary engine, which uses a small spinning triangle to make power, instead of a conventional Piston engine.</p>

                        <p> If you'd like to take a look at some modern japanese cars, check out the current online showrooms! I recommend looking into Toyota's Supra and 86! :D</p>
